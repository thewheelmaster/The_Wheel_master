      "description": "Over time, alloy wheels can lose their shine due to kerb damage, scratches, corrosion, or general wear and tear. Alloy wheel restoration (or refurbishment) is the process of repairing and refinishing your wheels to make them look as good as new—often at a fraction of the cost of buying replacements. At The Wheel Master, we use industry-leading equipment, premium materials, and skilled craftsmanship to restore your wheels to factory-fresh condition or even give them a custom new look.",
